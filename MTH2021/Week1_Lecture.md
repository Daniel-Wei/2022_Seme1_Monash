## Lecture 1
### 1. Linear system has more than one solution == has infinitely many solutions
### 2. Consistent: at least one solution(one or infinitely many)
### 3. Inconsistent: NO solution
### 4. Elementary Row operations
       - Multiple one row by non-zero
       - Interchange two rows
       - Add a multiple of one row to another
### 5. Row Echelon Form
       - Any zero rows at the bottom
       - First non-zero entry in each non-zero row(PIVOT) is to the right of pivots in the rows above
### 6. Reduced Row Echelon Form
       - Row Echelon Form
       - Each pivot is 1
       - Each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its COLUMN
       
## Lecture 2
### 1. Echelon Form of a given matrix is NOT Unique
### 2. Reduced Echelon form of a given matrix is UNIQUE
### 3. Leading Variables: Number of COLs containing pivots
### 4. Free Variables: Number of COLs NOT contaning pivots 
### 5. Number of Solutions of Ax = b determined by [U|c]
