### 1. Def: Distribution at time t and Probability Vectors
       - Consider a rnadom process, in which the system under study has N possible states
       - The Distribution at time t is an assignement of probabilities x1(t), x2(t), ... xn(t) to each of the N states
       - The quantity xi(t) in [0, 1] gives us the probability that the sys is in state i at time t
       - Vectors with non-negative entries which sum to 1 are called Probability Vectors
