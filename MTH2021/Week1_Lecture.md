## Lecture 1
### 1. Linear system has more than one solution == has infinitely many solutions
### 2. Consistent: at least one solution(one or infinitely many)
### 3. Inconsistent: NO solution
### 4. Elementary Row operations
####   Multiple one row by non-zero
####   Interchange two rows
####   Add a multiple of one row to another
### 5. Row Echelon Form: Any zero rows at the bottom; First non-zr
